                <h4>
                    From television to cinema, radio to podcasts, social media to blogs and
                    vlogs, and everything in between – media studies plays a big part of our
                    every day. And it’s never been so relevant than in the internet age, where
                    actors, singers, and personalities can make their own celebrity online using
                    their media skills. As technology, creativity, and competition increases,
                    these skills become more in demand all over the world.<br><br>
                    Media studies will equip you with the communication and technology
                    skills needed to succeed in the modern workplace, whether in the media
                    industry or not. Whether you choose to pursue a career in film and
                    television, fight for your own fame, or take your skills into business – you’ll
                    be well equipped for what the modern workplace is looking for.<br><br>

                    Needless to say, media studies is the most useful subject you can show
                    you’ve studied in your application for this degree. If you didn’t study it,
                    don’t worry, as the most common subjects in media studies applications
                    are English language and English literature. Psychology and sociology
                    are also useful, but it’s your passion for media that most universities will
                    be looking for.<br><br>
                    Media studies is more practical than academic, so be prepared to show
                    a portfolio or speak about your experience with the media. When it comes
                    to soft skills, you’ll want to show curiosity, a natural flair with technology,
                    creativity, consistency, patience.<br><br></h4>

                    Media studies is a broad subject, and journalism is one of many modules
                    on offer throughout the course. If you want to be a journalist, then
                    that’s your best degree choice. But if you want a range of options that
                    will get your foot in the door of a lot of careers in the media industry,
                    then media studies is for you.</h4>

                    Pursuing a job in the media industry is a competitive process, so a degree
                    in the field will help you stand out from the crowd. It will equip you with
                    skills ranging from copywriting to camera work, and gear you up for a
                    fastmoving industry that requires you to change with the times.<br><br>
                    Whether you want to be the brains behind the scenes of film and music,
                    or you want to make a difference as a broadcaster or journalist, a
                    degree in media studies will give you a shot at a number of different
                    careers.<br><br>
                    You can also use your media skills to investigate and analyse the theory
                    of media studies, helping businesses and organisations predict the
                    outcome of news items and current affairs. By looking at the history
                    of media studies and its place in society and culture, you can help design
                    public health campaigns, or advise on communications for big
                    businesses.<br><br>

                The job market for media studies graduates is competitive, and that’s
                reflected in the course. Don’t expect to be watching videos or listening
                to music all day, there’s a high degree of theoretical, research, and
                analytical work that goes hand-in-hand with the creative aspect of the
                subject.<br><br>
                As you look at the role of media studies in contemporary society, you can
                expect to recognise bits of other subjects in your studies, including
                history, sociology, philosophy, psychology, and politics. Whichever route
                you choose – academic or vocational – you can expect a lot of self-study.<br><br>
                Media studies are generally three years long, resulting in a BA. You may
                have the chance to add a sandwich year and spend 12 months in industry,
                meaning that your degree will last four years. With the competition for
                jobs in the media industry, you should consider your placement options
                very carefully. You may also want to develop a niche during your second
                and third years, when you begin to choose your own modules and
                specialise in certain areas.<br><br>
                With the media industry going through such rapid change, there has
                never been a better time to enter this academic field. The rise of online
                platforms, and the innovations within the traditional media giants, is
                creating a need for highly skilled media professionals who can adapt and
                change with the times.<br><br>
                Media studies undergraduates can expect the following tasks during their
                studies :</h4><br>
