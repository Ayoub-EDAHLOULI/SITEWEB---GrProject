			<h4>
		Philosophy and Modern Languages brings together some of the most 
                important approaches to understanding language, literature and ideas.<br><br>

                The study of philosophy develops analytical rigour and the ability to criticise
                and reason logically. It allows you to apply these skills to questions ranging
                from how we acquire knowledge and form moral judgements to the nature
                of language, art and literature. Since many works of literature are shaped by
                the dominant philosophical ideas of their epoch, study of philosophy can 
                illuminate that intellectual background.<br><br>

                The study of a modern European language develops analytical and critical
                abilities as well as highly competent linguistic skills. Studying the literature 
                written in that language contributes to an understanding of many aspects   
                of European culture, enabling students to develop attention to stylistic and 
                terminological detail and rhetorical strategies, and sensitivity to cultural and
                historical context, all of which are of great value to the study of philosophy.<br><br>
                Studying these two disciplines in parallel has numerous advantages and 
                affords students greater insights into each.<br><br>

                The Philosophy Faculty is the largest philosophy department in the UK, and
                one of the largest in the world, admitting around 450 undergraduates 
                annually to read the various degrees involving Philosophy. Many faculty 
                members have a worldwide reputation and our library and other facilities 
                are acknowledged as among the best in the country.<br><br>

                Oxford’s Modern Languages Faculty is one of the largest in the country, with
                a total intake of more than 250 students a year, including those reading
                joint degrees. The Taylor Institution is the biggest modern languages 
                research library in the UK. The Modern Languages Faculty also has an 
                undergraduate lending library, and students are able to take advantage of 
                the well-equipped Language Centre. </h4><br><br>

		Modern Languages students spend a compulsory year abroad, usually in 
                the third year. Past opportunities abroad have typically included working 
                as a paid language assistant in a school, undertaking an internship and/or
                studying at a University, all of which provide valuable experiences for 
                improving language competence.  However, for students choosing to 
                undertake activity in Europe, please note that the types and nature of 
                activities available may be subject to variation as arrangements relating to
                the UK’s departure from the EU are progressed. <br><br>

                The University is working with European partners to seek to maintain the
                opportunities available to its students on the same terms as previously, 
                and is committed to ensuring that funding arrangements remain similar to  
                those for previous years, as far as reasonably possible. As negotiations 
                relating to the UK’s departure from the EU advance, the availability of paid
                work in the EU, and the types or terms of work available for students 
                undertaking their year abroad, may vary. You can find the latest information
                here. Students will be kept informed of any developments relating to year
                abroad arrangements as these become clearer. <br><br>
 
                Students are also encouraged to spend as much of their vacations as  
                possible in the countries whose languages they are studying. <br><br>

                In certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the 
                health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make 
                adjustments to a course’s requirements for international study.<br><br> Students 
                who consider that they may be affected are asked to contact their 
                department for advice.</h4><br><br>

		Some year abroad activities may provide a salary. Students can apply for a 
                living costs grant, subject to the UK’s continued participation in the 
                Erasmus+ programme or an equivalent framework. In the event that 
                agency funding is not made available for Erasmus+ activity following the
                UK’s departure from the EU, the University has committed to providing  
                living costs grants on a similar basis to current Erasmus+ grants. However, 
                some costs related to year abroad activity may increase following the UK’s
                departure from the EU. You can find the latest information here.<br><br>

                Currently, eligible UK students can continue to access living costs funding
                from the UK government (Student Finance agencies) during their year 
                abroad. However, the level of government funding available to UK students
                on a year abroad may vary as a result of the UK’s departure from the EU. <br><br>
                UK students from lower-income households with means-tested 
                assessments will remain eligible for Oxford’s generous bursary provision.
                Travel grants may be available through your college and/or the Faculty. <br><br>
                For students who experience particular difficulties related to their year 
                abroad, some hardship funds are also available from the Faculty, and, 
                for UK students with a shortfall in their finances, the University’s Student 
                Support Fund can provide additional assistance. </h4><br><br>
