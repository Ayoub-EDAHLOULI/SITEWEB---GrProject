		Fine Art is the making and study of visual art. It educates and prepares 
                students to become artists and to follow other practices that are aligned 
                with the making of art. The curriculum is centred on the individual student’s
                potential and imagination.<br><br>

                The Ruskin School of Art offers a three-year studio-based BFA course in 
                which students work alongside each other in collaboratively-organised 
                studios. Whereas many fine art courses run in an environment devoted 
                exclusively to art and design, Ruskin students, as members of a collegiate 
                university, have the advantage of contact with their contemporaries on all 
                of Oxford’s other courses.<br><br>

                The Ruskin course aims to develop strong independent points of view and 
                a mature grasp of the range of critical debate surrounding contemporary 
                art and its many international histories. Oxford’s short terms, coupled with 
                the ambitious atmosphere at the Ruskin, suit highly-motivated and 
                resourceful students with a good sense of how to organise their time both
                in and out of Oxford.<br><br>

                The first year of the course is structured to introduce students to one 
                another, to the resources of the school and to the staff involved in teaching
                and running the Ruskin. Students will familiarise themselves with their 
                fellow students’ work, take part in group criticism and engage in intensive 
                dialogue with tutors and visiting artists.<br><br>

                The intimate working environment of the school, arranged in two buildings,
                allows art history, theory and criticism to be treated as integral to the 
                development of studio work. The Ruskin also enjoys a strong and
                constructive relationship with Modern Art Oxford (an exciting and 
                influential contemporary art space) and students have full access to the 
                many exceptional University libraries and museums, including the 
                Ashmolean and the Sackler Library.</h4><br><br>
