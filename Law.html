			<h4>
		Studying law will not only give you the opportunity to qualify as a solicitor 
                or barrister: it will also help you develop a diverse set of skills which you will
                be able to apply in many different situations. You will learn to assimilate 
                and analyse complex information, construct arguments, write with precision 
                and clarity and think on your feet.<br><br>

                The Oxford Law degree aims to develop all these skills, but its particular 
                strength is in teaching you to think for yourself. Students are expected to 
                read a good deal, mostly from primary sources, and to develop views not 
                simply about what the law is, but also about why it is so, whether it should 
                be so, and how it might be different.<br><br>

                There are two Law courses at Oxford: Course I is a three-year course; Course
                II is a four-year course which follows the same syllabus, but with a third 
                year abroad at a university in France, Germany, Italy, or Spain 
                (studying French, German, Italian, or Spanish law), or the Netherlands 
                (studying European and International law). Students on Course II 
                (Law with Law Studies in Europe) gain additional skills through exposure to 
                different legal systems and the different approaches to teaching practised
                by our European partner institutions. There is a risk that the UKâ€™s departure
                from the European Union may impact on the year abroad in Course II, as
                explained on the Fees and Funding tab.
