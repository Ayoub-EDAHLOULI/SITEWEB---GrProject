                Oxfordâ€™s History course combines the examination of large regions over
                extended periods of time with more focused work on smaller social groups,
                shorter periods and particular themes. It provides a distinctive education by
                developing an awareness of the differing political, cultural, social and economic
                structures within past societies and how they interrelate. The course combines
                vigorous debate over questions of interpretation with rigorous attention to
                source material, while the constant enrichment by cross-fertilisation from
                other disciplines leads to new questions about the past.<br><br>
                Oxford is celebrated for the broad chronological sweep of its courses and
                the enormous amount of choice offered. Students can study options on any
                part of British and European history from the declining years of the Roman
                Empire to the present day. The geographical range is also broad: there are
                options on North American, Latin American, Asian and African history
                (see the department website for further details). Students are encouraged to
                adopt a variety of interdisciplinary approaches to their work, and the faculty
                is strong on intellectual and cultural history options. The Oxford History
                Faculty is at the forefront of research.</h4>
