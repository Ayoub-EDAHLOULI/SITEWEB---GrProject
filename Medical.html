			<h4>
		The practice of Medicine offers a breadth of experiences impossible 
                to find in any other subject. Every day brings different patients with 
                different needs. It’s a great choice for scientists who strive to understand 
                and apply research findings to improve the lives of the patients in their 
                care. It offers a meaningful career that is prestigious, secure and well paid. 
                However, practising Medicine can be arduous, stressful, frustrating and  
                bureaucratic and is not suited to everyone. You need to be sure that 
                Medicine is the right choice for you. These pages will help you work that
                out, but there’s no better way to find out for sure than by gaining insight
                into medical practice by seeing it in action and talking to those who 
                provide healthcare. Studying Medicine because that is what is expected of 
                you is never a good idea; make sure that your motives for choosing to do
                so are well reasoned.<br><br>

                The Medicine course at Oxford provides a well-rounded intellectual training
                with particular emphasis on the basic science research that underpins 
                medicine. We have retained a distinct three-year pre-clinical stage that   
                includes studying towards a BA Honours degree in Medical Sciences, 
                followed by a three-year clinical stage. The Medical School at Oxford is  
                relatively small, allowing students and staff to get to know one another and
                benefit from a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.<br><br>

	    <h4>
		All A100 students at Oxford undertake an experimental research project 
                as part of their BA in Medical Sciences. This will be in a field of interest  
                to the student, and will offer valuable first-hand experience of scientific 
                research. Students have the opportunity to undertake research in a 
                laboratory from a wide range of departments within the Medical Sciences 
                Division.</h4>
